## 📧 Message Template Used

**Subject:** GroundCTRL - Feedback from a Real Satellite Operator Needed

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because of your [personalized background reference]. I'm part of
the Coding Temple Tech Residency program, and our team is developing GroundCTRL, an
interactive web-based satellite ground station simulation platform. Our goal is to
create a training tool that's as true to what is used in the industry as possible.

We want operators like you to review the platform and give us your honest feedback on:

What's working well?

What should we change?

What's missing?

Rather than scheduling a call, we'd love for you to explore the project at your own
pace and share your thoughts. Your real-world perspective is invaluable in ensuring
GroundCTRL genuinely reflects the tools and workflows you use every day.

If you're interested in reviewing the project, I'd be happy to provide access and
answer any questions you might have.

Learn more about me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/austinallencarlson/

Would you be open to taking a look and sharing your insights?

Thank you for considering this!

Best regards,
Austin Allen Carlson
Tech Residency Team Lead - GroundCTRL Project
Coding Temple
