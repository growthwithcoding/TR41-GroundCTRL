## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements specialized space mission control operations through five core business components:

## Mission Control Framework
Mission Control System (`src/config/missionControl.js`) establishes the operational foundation with custom status codes (GO, NO-GO, HOLD, ABORT) and station-based telemetry tracking infrastructure.

## Security Architecture 
Two interconnected security services manage access:
- Account Security (`src/services/lockoutService.js`) enforces mission-specific lockout policies with progressive duration penalties
- Operator Authentication (`src/services/authService.js`) implements Call Sign identification and station-specific clearance levels

## Communication Protocol
Mission Control Response Factory (`src/factories/responseFactory.js`) standardizes all system communications using:
- Mission control formatted responses
- Telemetry data integration
- Mission timestamps
- Mapped status codes

## Audit Infrastructure
Audit Factory (`src/factories/auditFactory.js`) maintains mission operation records through:
- Severity-based operation tracking
- Call sign operator attribution
- Chain of command logging
- Mission-specific event categories

The components form an integrated mission control center with specialized operator management, security protocols, and standardized communication formats centered around space operations.
