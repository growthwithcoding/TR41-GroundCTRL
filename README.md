# GroundCTRL - Mission Control Platform

## Virtual Satellite Simulator

**GroundCTRL** is a browser-based training simulator that introduces users to the fundamentals of satellite operations through interactive, guided missions. Players manage a virtual Earth-orbiting satellite using a simplified mission console, real-time AI guidance, and structured objectives that blend learning with gameplay. Designed for space enthusiasts, students, and new operators, the platform provides visual feedback, step-by-step tutorials, and progress tracking. The simulator runs in modern desktop browsers and aims to make satellite operations education engaging, accessible, and beginner-friendly. Built with **React**, **Node.js**, and **Firebase**.

## ✨ Implemented Features

### 🎮 Simulator State Management (January 2026)
Comprehensive real-time state tracking and synchronization system:
- **Command Tracking** - Track all commands executed since session start with full history
- **Telemetry Updates** - Real-time satellite telemetry updates every 2 seconds with 100-snapshot history
- **Scenario Step Progression** - Automatic/manual mission step completion with progress tracking
- **SocketIO Synchronization** - Real-time state sync between frontend and backend
- **Command Effects** - Commands actually affect simulation physics (orbital maneuvers, power draw, etc.)
- **Alert System** - System alerts with acknowledgment tracking
- **State Persistence** - Automatic Firestore persistence and recovery

## 🧪 Automated Testing Suite (January 2026)

Comprehensive testing automation with Jest, SuperTest, and Playwright:

### Quick Start
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
npm install
npm test

# Frontend E2E tests (CURRENTLY DISABLED)
# E2E tests have been temporarily removed to prevent interference with development
# They will be re-implemented in a future update when the frontend is more stable
```

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Jest for isolated component testing
- **Integration Tests**: SuperTest for API endpoint testing  
- **E2E Tests**: ⚠️ Temporarily disabled (future implementation planned)
- **Security Tests**: Security vulnerability testing
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing on every PR

### Available Commands
```bash
# Backend testing
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests (requires emulators)
npm run test:security      # Security tests
npm run test:coverage      # With coverage report

# Frontend E2E testing - TEMPORARILY DISABLED
# npm run test:e2e          # (Removed - will be restored in future update)
# npm run test:e2e:ui       # (Removed - will be restored in future update)
# npm run test:e2e:headed   # (Removed - will be restored in future update)
```

### CI/CD Integration
- ✅ Automated testing on every Pull Request
- ⚠️ Multi-browser E2E testing (temporarily disabled)
- ✅ Test result summaries and artifact collection
- ✅ Firebase emulator integration for isolated testing
